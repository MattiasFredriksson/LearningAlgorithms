Digit recognition classifier utilizing features extracted from skeletal representations in the image. Feature extraction is achieved by creating a skeletal representation using the graph formed from connected pixel clusters. The project was part of the examination for course DV2542.

Visualizations of the outcomes were performed for a visualization course DV1474.
