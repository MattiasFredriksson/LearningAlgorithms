# LearningAlgorithms

Digit recognition classifier utilizing features extracted from skeletal representations in the image. Feature extraction is achieved by creating a skeletal representation using graphs formed from connected pixel clusters. The project was part of the examination for course DV2542 and is summarized in the [report](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/LearningAlgorithms/blob/master/docs/Pixel%20Clustering%20for%20Skeletal%20Extraction%20in%20Digit%20Images.pdf). 

Visualizations of the feature space was later performed for a visualization course DV1474.
